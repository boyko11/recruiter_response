If you ever find yourself sending more or less the same response to recruiters,  
You might find this semi-useful.  
The idea is to click on the .bat file, then just follow the command line input prompts.  
The input is used to fill out a response template, which gets written to a file.  
You could then open this file and just copy/paste the response.  
Feel free to gut it any way you like.  
Cheers!
